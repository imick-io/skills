**Wayfinder autopilot.** `/wayfinder <epic> autopilot` (or `Mode: autopilot` in a map's Notes, with an optional threshold, 75 by default) resolves the map without asking: each decision in its own subagent, decided when at or above the threshold, researched with `dig` when below, and decided as **assumed** if still unsure. Prototypes are judged by the agent; tasks that need a person are parked. The spec it writes lists every decision least confident first, waits on `ready-for-human`, and is approved with the new **`spec-approved`** label; review comments make it revise. The agent loop's new **`--autopilot`** flag does this unattended: it charts untouched epics, resolves autopilot maps, pings Slack when a spec is ready, and cuts tickets once you approve.

**Fix**: skills marked manual-only (`implement`, `debug-and-fix`, `verify-epic`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets`, `wayfinder`, `dig`) can't be called through the Skill tool, so the agent loop's prompts and `product-design` now read and follow those skills' files instead. UI specs from `product-design` are labelled `spec`, so they're never built directly.
