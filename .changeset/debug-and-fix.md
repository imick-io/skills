New **`debug-and-fix`** skill: works one bug from the `ready-for-agent-debugging` queue end to end. It claims the bug, branches (`fix/<n>-<slug>`, or the epic's branch for bugs under an epic), runs `diagnosing-bugs` (browser reproduction for UI bugs), and fixes it with a regression test when the diagnosis is clean: a PR with `Fixes #n`, or a commit on the epic branch. Otherwise it leaves a full diagnosis for a person. The issue ends labelled by outcome: `bug` + `ready-for-review` (fixed), `bug` + `ready-for-human` (diagnosed), `needs-info` (can't reproduce) or `wontfix`.

Adds the **`ready-for-review`** label ("a fix PR waits for review") to the triage vocabulary and `triage-labels.md`. Projects already set up: create it with `gh label create ready-for-review`.
