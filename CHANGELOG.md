## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/imick-io/skills/pull/6) [`c4db274`](https://github.com/imick-io/skills/commit/c4db2746b53349229e2d4237a41c13740ccdeb79) Thanks [@imick-io](https://github.com/imick-io)! - New **`debug-and-fix`** skill: works one bug from the `ready-for-agent-debugging` queue end to end. It claims the bug, branches (`fix/<n>-<slug>`, or the epic's branch for bugs under an epic), runs `diagnosing-bugs` (browser reproduction for UI bugs), and fixes it with a regression test when the diagnosis is clean: a PR with `Fixes #n`, or a commit on the epic branch. Otherwise it leaves a full diagnosis for a person. The issue ends labelled by outcome: `bug` + `ready-for-review` (fixed), `bug` + `ready-for-human` (diagnosed), `needs-info` (can't reproduce) or `wontfix`.
  
  Adds the **`ready-for-review`** label ("a fix PR waits for review") to the triage vocabulary and `triage-labels.md`. Projects already set up: create it with `gh label create ready-for-review`.

- [#5](https://github.com/imick-io/skills/pull/5) [`75b5a09`](https://github.com/imick-io/skills/commit/75b5a098a6fdfc265ad38abcf9e8b97c555317d1) Thanks [@imick-io](https://github.com/imick-io)! - `diagnosing-bugs` reproduces UI bugs in a real browser before scripting them. A new `BROWSER.md` covers picking a browser (Claude in Chrome first, then `agent-browser`, then the Playwright MCP), running the app or opening the preview URL with test accounts only, following the reporter's steps while watching screenshots, console and network, capturing the evidence, and freezing the steps into a Playwright script that becomes the Phase 1 feedback loop.

- [#3](https://github.com/imick-io/skills/pull/3) [`afb4b6e`](https://github.com/imick-io/skills/commit/afb4b6eb866d615330815b52adc3a14a07184a73) Thanks [@imick-io](https://github.com/imick-io)! - Sync Matt Pocock's skills up to his 1.3.1 (and later unreleased fixes).
  
  - **`implement-spec`**, **`pr`** and **`retro`** graduate from `in-progress` to `engineering`, so they ship in the plugin. `ask-imick` routes them: `/implement-spec` builds a whole spec in one run on an integration branch, `/pr` shapes PR bodies, `/retro` closes the main flow.
  - **`resolving-merge-conflicts` is removed**, as upstream: the agent works through conflicts without a dedicated skill.
  - **`CONTEXT.md` is now `GLOSSARY.md`** (and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` is `GLOSSARY-MAP.md`) in every skill that reads or writes it, including `product-design` and `setup-imick-skills`. In a project set up before this, run `git mv CONTEXT.md GLOSSARY.md` (and the same for `CONTEXT-MAP.md`).
  - `diagnosing-bugs` no longer hands off to `improve-codebase-architecture` from its post-mortem; cross-skill calls use the more reliable "Call the Skill tool" wording.
  - `update-from-upstream`: detaching a skill now declines its upstream original, so it never comes back as a "new" skill.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- First versioned release. iMick's own skills (`scope-decomposer`, `product-design`, `dig`, `plan-work`, `do-work`, `review-work`, `update-from-upstream`, and a rewritten `triage` with an unattended mode), Matt Pocock's skills (customized where noted in `sources.json`), and Cursor's `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`. Ships the shared automatic-triage and token-check workflows, pinned by projects as `@v1`.
- `update-from-upstream` shows each source's changelog entries since the last sync (for sources with a `changelog_path`), and quotes them alongside every question about a new, moved or deleted skill.
